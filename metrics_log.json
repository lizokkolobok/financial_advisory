    "model": "Given your profile as a cautious investor with a beginner level of experience, it's important to balance your investment strategy to align with your goals and risk tolerance. Here are five investment advice points tailored to your situation:\n\n1. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across various asset classes. Your current allocation of 40% low risk, 40% medium risk, and 20% high risk is a balanced approach. Consider including bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and index funds for stability, while cautiously exploring growth stocks or sectors for the high-risk portion.\n\n2. **Regular Portfolio Review and Rebalancing**: Schedule regular reviews of your portfolio, at least annually, to assess performance and make necessary adjustments. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level and takes advantage of market opportunities, which can be crucial given your medium-term horizon.\n\n3. **Emergency Fund and Risk Management**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund equivalent to at least 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund should be kept in a highly liquid, low-risk account to prevent the need to sell investments during market downturns. Additionally, consider insurance products for added financial security.\n\n4. **Education and Continuous Learning**: As a beginner, investing in your financial education will be invaluable. Consider attending workshops, reading investment books, or following reputable financial news sources. This will help you make informed decisions and reduce susceptibility to biases such as overconfidence or herd behavior.\n\n5. **Stay Disciplined and Avoid Emotional Decisions**: Emotional reactions, especially during market volatility, can lead to poor investment decisions. Develop a disciplined strategy aligned with your goals and time horizon, and stick to it. Avoid making impulsive changes based on short-term market movements or media noise.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a robust investment strategy that aligns with your cautious nature, providing a solid foundation for your financial future while considering potential behavioral biases.",

    "model": "Based on your profile as a cautious investor with a balanced risk allocation strategy, here are some tailored investment recommendations, while considering potential behavioral finance biases such as loss aversion and overconfidence:\n\n- **Diversify Across Asset Classes:** To align with your cautious nature and risk allocation preferences, ensure your investments are spread across different asset classes. This includes low-risk options like bonds, medium-risk investments such as dividend-paying stocks, and a smaller allocation to high-risk assets like growth stocks or emerging markets. Diversification helps mitigate risks and stabilize returns.\n\n- **Regular Portfolio Review:** Schedule regular reviews of your investment portfolio, at least annually. This will help you stay on track with your goals and make adjustments as needed. It also prevents overconfidence by ensuring your investments continue to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.\n\n- **Stay Informed, But Avoid Overreacting:** Keep yourself updated with financial news and market trends, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. This can help counteract loss aversion, where the fear of losses might lead to premature selling of assets, potentially missing long-term gains.\n\n- **Set Clear Financial Goals:** Clearly define your financial goals for the 5-year horizon. Whether it's saving for a significant purchase, retirement planning, or wealth accumulation, having specific targets can guide your investment choices and keep you focused, reducing the risk of decision fatigue.\n\n- **Consider Professional Management:** Given your beginner experience, consider leveraging professional financial management services or consulting with a financial advisor regularly. This can provide you with expert guidance, help manage biases like overconfidence, and ensure your investment strategy remains consistent with your risk tolerance and goals.",
