  "advice": "Based on your profile as a cautious investor with a balanced allocation of risk in your investment strategy, here are some tailored investment advice points for you to consider:\n\n1. **Diversify to Mitigate Risk**: Given your allocation towards low and medium-risk investments, ensure that your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, such as bonds, mutual funds, and index funds. This diversification can help protect against market volatility and reduce potential losses.\n\n2. **Educate and Stay Informed**: As a beginner, it is beneficial to continuously educate yourself on investment fundamentals and stay informed about market trends. This can help you make more informed decisions and reduce susceptibility to common biases, such as herd behavior, where you might be influenced by the actions of others rather than your own research.\n\n3. **Focus on Long-term Goals**: With an 11-year time horizon, it's important to remain focused on your long-term goals rather than short-term market fluctuations. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on market noise, and consider periodic reviews of your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals.\n\n4. **Leverage Professional Guidance**: Given your cautious nature and beginner status, you may benefit from regular consultations with a financial advisor. This can help you avoid biases like overconfidence or loss aversion by providing an objective perspective on your investment choices.\n\n5. **Maintain a Balanced Approach**: Your current risk allocation is quite balanced, which is suitable for your cautious profile. Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and make adjustments if your financial situation or goals change. Consider using automated tools or robo-advisors to help maintain this balance without reacting emotionally to market changes."
