  "advice": "Based on your profile and investment preferences, here are some tailored investment recommendations for you:\n\n1. **Diversify Across Asset Classes:**\n   - Given your cautious nature and balanced risk allocation, ensure that your low and medium-risk investments are diversified across various asset classes such as bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). This can help mitigate risks while aiming for steady returns.\n\n2. **Leverage Index Funds and ETFs:**\n   - Utilize index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both your medium and low-risk portions. This approach offers diversification within asset categories, reduces management fees, and aligns well with a long-term investment strategy.\n\n3. **Allocate a Portion to Defensive Stocks:**\n   - For the medium-risk allocation, consider including defensive stocks, such as those in consumer staples or utilities. These stocks tend to be less volatile and can provide steady dividends, aligning with your cautious and somewhat risk-averse nature.\n\n4. **Manage Behavioral Biases:**\n   - Be mindful of potential biases like loss aversion, where the fear of losses might lead you to overly conservative choices. Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor to maintain objectivity.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Guidance for High-Risk Investments:**\n   - With a substantial portion allocated to high-risk investments, engaging with a financial advisor or investment professional can provide insights and help you make informed decisions. They can assist in navigating complex markets and selecting high-risk opportunities that align with your overall strategy.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you can build a well-rounded portfolio that aligns with your cautious investment style while considering your significant income and financial goals."
