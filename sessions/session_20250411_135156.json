Consider a mix of high-quality bonds, blue-chip stocks, and a selection of international equities to provide stability and capture global growth opportunities.\n\n2. **Invest in Luxury Sector Funds**: Given the goal of lifestyle upgrades, allocate a portion of the portfolio to funds focusing on luxury goods, services, and experiences.
