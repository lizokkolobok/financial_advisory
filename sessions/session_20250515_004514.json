This can include investing in international stocks and bonds.\n\n2. **Focus on Low-Risk Assets**:\n   - Allocate more of your investments towards low-risk assets such as government bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs), and high-quality dividend-paying stocks. These will help stabilize your portfolio and provide steady income.\n\n3. **Long-Term Perspective**:\n   - Maintain a long-term perspective.
